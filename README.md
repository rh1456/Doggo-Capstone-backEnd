This is the back-end for my Capstone project. 

This dotnet program uses a variety of tables that help define what a 'Match' is for the user. 
There are two tables to outline a dogs "Energy Level" and "Age". These tables are related to the corresponding "Interested" tables and to the User table through foreign keys.

The "Match" controller uses a basic algorithim to tell the program which user profiles to pull up based on the traits and age the user has defined upon account creation.
